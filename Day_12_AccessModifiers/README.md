# Java Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are keywords that define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and constructors within a program. There are four main access modifiers in Java:

1. **Public (`public`):** The most permissive access modifier. Members (classes, methods, variables, etc.) declared as `public` can be accessed from anywhere, both within the same package and from other packages.

2. **Private (`private`):** The most restrictive access modifier. Members declared as `private` are only accessible within the same class. They cannot be accessed from other classes, even if they are in the same package.

3. **Default (Package-Private):** If no access modifier is specified, Java uses the default access modifier. Members with default access are accessible within the same package but not from outside the package.

4. **Protected (`protected`):** Members declared as `protected` are accessible within the same package and also by subclasses (even if they are in different packages). However, they are not accessible by classes that are not subclasses of the defining class.

Here's a breakdown of how these access modifiers can be used:

- **For Classes:**
  - `public` classes can be accessed from anywhere.
  - `default` (no modifier) classes can be accessed within the same package.
  - `private` classes are not allowed at the top level (i.e., you cannot declare a top-level class as `private`).

- **For Class Members (Fields, Methods, Constructors, Nested Classes, etc.):**
  - `public` members can be accessed from anywhere.
  - `private` members are only accessible within the same class.
  - `default` members can be accessed within the same package.
  - `protected` members can be accessed within the same package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).

Examples:

```java
public class PublicExample {
    public int publicField;
    public void publicMethod() { /* ... */ }
}

class DefaultExample { // Default access modifier (package-private)
    int defaultField;
    void defaultMethod() { /* ... */ }
}

class AnotherClass {
    private int privateField; // Only accessible within this class
    protected int protectedField; // Accessible within this class and subclasses
}

public class SubclassExample extends AnotherClass {
    public void accessFields() {
        int value = publicField; // Accessible
        value = defaultField; // Accessible within the same package
        // value = privateField; // Not accessible (private)
        value = protectedField; // Accessible (protected)
    }
}
```

Remember that choosing the appropriate access modifier is crucial for maintaining the encapsulation and security of your classes and their members in your Java code.
