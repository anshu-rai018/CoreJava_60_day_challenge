# Java Anonymous Class

An anonymous class is a local class that does not have a name. It is defined and instantiated in a single step, and it is often used when you need to create a one-time-use class for a specific task or to implement an interface or extend a class without explicitly defining a new class.

Here's the basic syntax of defining an anonymous class:

```java
interface MyInterface {
    void doSomething();
}

public class MyClass {
    public void performAction() {
        MyInterface myInterface = new MyInterface() {
            @Override
            public void doSomething() {
                System.out.println("Doing something anonymously!");
            }
        };
        
        myInterface.doSomething();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.performAction();
    }
}
```

In the above example, an anonymous class that implements the `MyInterface` interface is created within the `performAction` method of the `MyClass` class. This anonymous class overrides the `doSomething` method of the interface.

Anonymous classes are useful when you need to create a simple, short-lived class that you don't plan to reuse elsewhere in your code. They are commonly used in event handling, such as for implementing listeners, and for passing behaviors as arguments to methods.

Keep in mind that anonymous classes have some limitations compared to named classes. They cannot have constructors other than the default one, and they cannot be used for creating complex or long-lived classes. If you need to create a more complex class or reuse the class in multiple places, it's better to define a named inner class or a separate top-level class.
