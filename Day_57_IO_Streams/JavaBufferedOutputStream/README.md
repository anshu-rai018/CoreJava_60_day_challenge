# Java BufferedOutputStream

`BufferedOutputStream` is a class in Java that provides buffering for an output stream, which can improve the efficiency of writing data to the underlying output stream. It's part of the Java I/O (Input/Output) classes and is used to write data to an output stream with better performance compared to writing directly to the stream.

Here's how you typically use `BufferedOutputStream` in Java:

1. Import the necessary classes:

```java
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```

2. Create an instance of `BufferedOutputStream` by wrapping it around an existing output stream, such as a `FileOutputStream`:

```java
try (BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("example.txt"))) {
    // Write data to the BufferedOutputStream
    String data = "Hello, BufferedOutputStream!";
    byte[] bytes = data.getBytes();
    bos.write(bytes);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the code above, we create a `BufferedOutputStream` called `bos` that wraps a `FileOutputStream` to write data to a file named "example.txt." The `BufferedOutputStream` adds a buffer to reduce the number of actual write operations to the underlying file, which can improve performance when writing data in small chunks.

3. Close the `BufferedOutputStream` when you're done with it. The `try-with-resources` statement is used here to automatically close the stream after exiting the try block.

`BufferedOutputStream` is particularly useful when writing data to slow output sources like files, as it minimizes the number of actual write operations, thereby reducing I/O overhead and potentially improving your program's performance.

Keep in mind that the buffer size used by `BufferedOutputStream` can affect its performance. The default buffer size is typically sufficient for most cases, but you can also specify a custom buffer size when creating the `BufferedOutputStream` by using a constructor that accepts an additional argument for the buffer size.
