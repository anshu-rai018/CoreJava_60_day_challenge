# Java BufferedInputStream

`BufferedInputStream` is a class in Java that provides buffering for an input stream, which can improve the efficiency of reading data from the underlying input stream. It's part of the Java I/O (Input/Output) classes and is used to read data from an input stream with better performance compared to reading directly from the stream.

Here's how you typically use `BufferedInputStream` in Java:

1. Import the necessary classes:

```java
import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```

2. Create an instance of `BufferedInputStream` by wrapping it around an existing input stream, such as a `FileInputStream`:

```java
try (BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("example.txt"))) {
    // Read data from the BufferedInputStream
    int data;
    while ((data = bis.read()) != -1) {
        // Process the data
        System.out.print((char) data);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the code above, we create a `BufferedInputStream` called `bis` that wraps a `FileInputStream` to read data from a file named "example.txt." The `BufferedInputStream` adds a buffer to reduce the number of actual read operations from the underlying file, which can improve performance when reading data in small chunks.

3. Close the `BufferedInputStream` when you're done with it. The `try-with-resources` statement is used here to automatically close the stream after exiting the try block.

`BufferedInputStream` is particularly useful when reading data from slow input sources like files, as it minimizes the number of actual read operations, thereby reducing I/O overhead and potentially improving your program's performance.

Keep in mind that the buffer size used by `BufferedInputStream` can affect its performance. The default buffer size is typically sufficient for most cases, but you can also specify a custom buffer size when creating the `BufferedInputStream` by using a constructor that accepts an additional argument for the buffer size.
